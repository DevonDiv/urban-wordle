# Urban Wordle

## Link to Live Project - https://sharp-goldberg-2f8e3e.netlify.app/

## Description

This project was inspired by the popular game Wordle on The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). The motivation behind this project was to work on my JavaScript and CSS skills.

## Usage

Urban Wordle uses an Urban Dictionary API to find a random five letter word to guess. You have 6 guesses to enter the correct word. If the letter appears green, you have guess the correct letter in the correct spot. If the letter appears yellow, you have guessed the correct letter but the incorrect location. If the letter goes dark, the letter is not in the word at all.
